<p>Code review is an industry-standard systematic, methodical
examination of source code to identify bugs, adherence to coding
standards, and improve overall code quality. The importance of computer
science professionals catching errors early reduces development costs
and facilitates knowledge sharing among team members. Best practices for
code review include setting clear guidelines, reviewing small code
changes to ensure they don’t break the program, and providing
constructive feedback while focusing on the efficacy of design and
logic. Code reviews should be routine throughout the SDLC, ideally after
each significant code change, to maintain code quality and mitigate
potential technical debt.</p>

<p>I chose OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) for recording my code review
because I was already familiar with how it works, and it’s relatively
easy to use while still being free of charge. For the code review, I
created an outline focusing on structure and efficiency, logic and
functionality, security and documentation. For structure and efficiency,
I reviewed code organization, modularity, and performance optimization.
For logic and functionality, I evaluated the existence of any logical
errors, and honed in on error handling/input validation. For security
and documentation, I assessed potential vulnerabilities and the quality
of comments/documentation.</p>
