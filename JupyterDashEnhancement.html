id="briefly-describe-the-artifact.-what-is-it-when-was-it-created"><strong>Briefly
describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</strong></h3>
<p>The artifact is a script that creates a Jupyter Dashboard; the logic
includes a set of database queries designed to retrieve records of
rescued animals from a .csv spreadsheet. Each animal’s record is
displayed in a table on the dashboard, including latitude and longitude
data that is rendered on a geolocation map. Available animals are
visualized in a pie chart. This artifact was created last term during
the 340 Client Server course.</p>

the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select
this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills
and abilities in software development? How was the artifact
improved?</strong></h3>
<p>I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my
ability to design and optimize databases to meet complex data
requirements. The artifact showcases my skills in advanced database
design, optimization techniques, and efficient database query writing.
The enhancement improved the artifact by adding a filter for animal age,
which is crucial for focusing analysis on specific age groups. This
improvement aligns with real-world needs where a rescue animal will be
adopted based upon their age or development.</p>

you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement
in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage
plans?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, I met the course objectives planned for Module One, specifically
CO3: Design and optimize databases to support complex data requirements.
The enhancement of adding age-based filtering options directly aligns
with this objective. Currently, I have no updates to my outcome-coverage
plans as the enhancement successfully met the intended goals.</p>

id="reflect-on-the-process-of-enhancing-and-modifying-the-artifact.-what-did-you-learn-as-you-were-creating-it-and-improving-it-what-challenges-did-you-face"><strong>Reflect
on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you
learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you
face?</strong></h3>
<p>Enhancing and modifying the artifact taught me the importance of
considering geographic factors in database queries, especially for
datasets with global operations. I learned how to implement efficient
filtering techniques to focus on specific regions, which is crucial for
targeted analysis. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the
filtering enhancement for age did not impact the functionality or
performance of the queries.</p>
<p>To overcome this, I used iterative development and incremental
debugging to ensure the efficacy of the finished product, which
involved:</p>
<p>-Using vectorized operations provided by pandas for filtering.</p>
<p>-Minimizing the number of times the DataFrame was modified within the
function.</p>
<p>-Testing with different combinations of filter-type and
age-group.</p>
<p>-Ensuring that the filtered data accurately reflected the selected
criteria.</p>
<p>-Checking the performance to ensure that the dashboard remained
responsive.</p>

program, along with a .png file for the company logo and a .csv for the
dataset; both external components are referenced within the program by
their relative paths. All a user needs to do is run the .ipynb file to
interact with the table’s radio buttons, and click the “Select” dropdown
to utilize the filtering functionality.</mark></p>
