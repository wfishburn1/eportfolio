    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio! Enjoy :)</h1>
    
    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>Completing my coursework and developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in showcasing my strengths, shaping my professional goals and values, and preparing me to enter the computer science field. Hereâ€™s how:</p>
    
    <h3>Input Validation</h3>
    <p>In the development of the Animal Rescue Java App, I designed and implemented a system that allows animals to be reserved and added to a reservation list. This project honed my skills in Input Validation/Sanitation, to the benefit of my End Users success in using the application.</p>
    
    <h3>Advanced Database Operations</h3>
    <p>My coursework included extensive work with advanced database operations. During the development of the Pymongo App for Rescuing Animals Based on Environment Types, I implemented complex filtering by age and location, and integrated geolocation maps into the dashboard. This experience enhanced my ability to manage and query data efficiently, providing users with a powerful and intuitive interface.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
    <p>My coursework included extensive work with data structures and algorithms, which are fundamental to computer science. The Binary Search Tree (Doubly Linked) project is a prime example. Implementing this data structure required a deep understanding of algorithms and their efficiency, which is critical for developing optimized and effective software solutions.</p>
    
    <h3>Software Engineering and Database</h3>
    <p>In the Animal Rescue Java App, I applied software engineering principles to design a robust and scalable application. Additionally, the Pymongo App project involved working with databases, where I utilized MongoDB to manage and query data efficiently. These projects reinforced my understanding of software development life cycles, database management, and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code.</p>
    
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>Security is a paramount concern in software development. Throughout my coursework, I learned about various security practices and implemented them in my projects. For example, in the Animal Rescue Java App, I ensured that user data was securely handled and stored, protecting it from potential threats.</p>
