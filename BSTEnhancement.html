Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it
created?</u></strong></h3>
<p>The artifact is an enhanced Binary Search Tree (BST) with integrated
Doubly Linked List (DLL) functionality. The BST allows efficient
insertion, deletion, and searching of bid data, while the DLL maintains
the order of bids as they are inserted, providing an alternative way to
display and traverse the bids. The initial project was created in Fall
of 2023 as part of a coursework exercise to demonstrate advanced data
structure implementation and manipulation in C++.</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>I. Why did you select this item?</strong></p>
<p>I selected this artifact because it represents a significant
advancement in my understanding and implementation of complex data
structures. It showcases my ability to integrate multiple data
structures to solve computing problems efficiently. This project
highlights my proficiency in C++ and my capability to design algorithms
that enhance functionality and performance.</p>
<p><strong>II. What specific components of the artifact showcase your
skills and abilities in software development?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data Structure Integration</strong>: The combination of
BST and DLL to maintain bid order and provide efficient search
capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithm Design</strong>: Efficient insertion, deletion,
and search algorithms within the BST.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Modularity</strong>: The clear separation of
concerns with different classes and methods handling specific
tasks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Handling and Validation</strong>: Robust error
handling to manage user inputs and ensure the stability of the
application.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. How was the artifact improved?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Functionality</strong>: Added the Doubly linked-list(DLL)
to maintain the order of bids and provide an additional traversal
method.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Optimized algorithms for insertion,
deletion, and traversal in the BST and DLL.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Readability and Maintainability</strong>: Enhanced
with detailed comments and refactored for clarity and
modularity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>3) Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet
with this enhancement in Module One?</u></strong></p>
<p>The enhancements made in Module One aligned with my course
objectives, particularly in improving code readability, error handling,
and refactoring. These improvements helped in achieving:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Better Code Maintainability</strong>: Through refactoring
and documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimized Performance</strong>: By including doubly
linked list functionality built on top of existing
functionality..</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I. Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage
plans?</strong></p>
<p>There have been no major changes to the outcome-coverage plans. The
enhancements met the initial objectives and demonstrated a clear
improvement in my software development capabilities.</p>

Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the
artifact.</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>I. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving
it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Effective Error Handling</strong>: Proper validation and
error handling improve user experience and prevent application crashes
due to unexpected inputs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Refactoring</strong>: During the refactoring
process, it was important to declare the DLL class functions before the
BST class, for forward declaration purposes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. What challenges did you face?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Extending the functionality of this code took time and attention
to detail, in order to not break the existing code and successfully
implement the DLL extension. I had to carefully debug at each juncture
to ensure the code still works after refactoring.</p></li>

Checklist</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Enhancement 1: Integrate Doubly Linked List (DLL)
Functionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description</strong>: Added DLL functionality to the
Binary Search Tree (BST) to enable bid traversal in both forward and
backward directions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Provides an alternative method to
traverse and manage the BST nodes, improving the ability to access and
display bid information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>DLLNode Class</strong>: Implemented a DLLNode class with
prev and next pointers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DLL Management</strong>: Added methods to the
BinarySearchTree class to handle DLL operations such as appending nodes
and traversing the list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration</strong>: Updated Insert and Remove methods
to maintain consistency between the BST and DLL.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancement 2: Add Additional Functionalities (Balancing
Tree)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Description</strong>: Implement functionalities to
balance the BST, ensuring optimal performance for insertion, deletion,
and search operations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Enhances the efficiency of the BST by
maintaining a balanced structure, which improves operation time
complexity.</p></li>
