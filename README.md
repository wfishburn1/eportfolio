**Professional Self-Assessment**
Completing my coursework and developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in showcasing my strengths, shaping my professional goals and values, and preparing me to enter the computer science field. Hereâ€™s how:

**Input Validation**
In the development of the Animal Rescue Java App, I designed and implemented a system that allows animals to be reserved and added to a reservation list. This project honed my skills in Input Validation/Sanitation, to the benefit of my End Users success in using the application.

**Advanced Database Operations**
My coursework included extensive work with advanced database operations. During the development of the Pymongo App for Rescuing Animals Based on Environment Types, I implemented complex filtering by age and location, and integrated geolocation maps into the dashboard. This experience enhanced my ability to manage and query data efficiently, providing users with a powerful and intuitive interface.

**Data Structures and Algorithms**
My coursework included extensive work with data structures and algorithms, which are fundamental to computer science. The Binary Search Tree (Doubly Linked) project is a prime example. Implementing this data structure required a deep understanding of algorithms and their efficiency, which is critical for developing optimized and effective software solutions.

**Software Engineering and Database**
In the Animal Rescue Java App, I applied software engineering principles to design a robust and scalable application. Additionally, the Pymongo App project involved working with databases, where I utilized MongoDB to manage and query data efficiently. These projects reinforced my understanding of software development life cycles, database management, and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code.

**Security**
Security is a paramount concern in software development. Throughout my coursework, I learned about various security practices and implemented them in my projects. For example, in the Animal Rescue Java App, I ensured that user data was securely handled and stored, protecting it from potential threats.

**Summary of Artifacts**
The artifacts in my ePortfolio demonstrate a comprehensive range of my computer science skills and abilities. Each project showcases different aspects of my expertise:

Animal Rescue Java App: Highlights my ability to work in a team, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and apply software engineering principles.
Binary Search Tree (Doubly Linked): Demonstrates my proficiency in data structures and algorithms.
Pymongo App for Rescuing Animals Based on Environment Types: Showcases my skills in database management and security practices.
