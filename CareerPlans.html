<p><strong><u>Part One</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Have you changed your career plans? If so, what prompted this
change? If not, why have you remained with your original
plan?</strong></p>
<p>Since beginning a Web Development apprenticeship two weeks ago, I see
a clear path towards becoming a MS Power Platform developer. This past
Friday, I obtained my very first Power Platform certification so I will
continue in this direction. I have been educated on the ubiquity of this
platform amongst Fortune 500 companies and the impact that it is making
on the industry, lowering the barrier to entry for civilian developers
by way of low-code/no-code application building, with customization
opportunities via C# programming!</p>
<p><strong>How has your thinking about your career evolved?</strong></p>
<p>As I learn more about emerging technologies and the landscape of
Computer Science, I have become more open to career opportunities not in
Core software development. This causes me to stay vigilant in learning
new technical stacks and not become complacent with my current skill
set. For example, I have been made aware of the amount of resources
invested into the current AI boom by the largest technology firms in the
world; billions of dollars are being poured into AI development;
therefore, my thinking has evolved in a business sense to follow where
the money is going, and not just focus on my personal interests.</p>
<p><strong>Have you completed any research about your choice of career?
How has this impacted your thinking? Have you thought about seeking an
advanced degree or certification after earning your undergraduate
degree?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! Since I started this program, I have been scouring the
internet and my peers to ascertain which direction I should go,
career-wise. I have been set on being a professional backend developer
and cybersecurity professional. This has impacted my thinking by giving
me a narrow-minded focus on becoming the aforementioned by way of
obtaining Java and cloud-based certifications, as well as hands-on
experience with backend programming. More recently I’ve learned about
all of the ways Microsoft Power Platform can make development more
streamlined, so I plan to obtain all of the MS Power Platform
certifications during my current Web Development apprenticeship.</p>
<p><strong>Which course outcomes have you achieved so far, and which
ones remain?</strong></p>
<p>Reflecting on the course objectives, I’ve made progress in code
optimization, enhancing error handling, and improving documentation
practices, which satisfies course outcome <strong>CO1(</strong>Apply
appropriate software engineering methodologies to develop a complex
software system). With this updated enhancement to my DSA project, I
have satisfied <strong>CO2(</strong> Design and implement efficient
algorithms to solve computing problems) as well.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my skills by integrating
more advanced features, such as <strong>CO3:</strong> complex database
interactions to further enrich my ePortfolio and <strong>CO5:</strong>
Implement security measures to protect user data and maintain compliance
with regulations.</p>
