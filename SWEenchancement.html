Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it
created?</u></strong></h3>
<p>The artifact is a Rescue Animal system built for animal shelters,
developed as a Java application for managing and reserving animals;
specifically dogs and monkeys. The system allows users to intake new
animals, reserve animals based on availability, and print lists of
animals by animal type or as a collection of all animals. This project
was created in January 2023 and was my first Java project.</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>I. Why did you select this item?</strong></p>
<p>I selected this artifact because it represents a foundational project
that demonstrates my initial foray into Java programming. It showcases
my ability to design and implement a functional application using core
Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, data management, and
user input handling. This project serves as a concrete example of my
early development skills and my progress over time.</p>
<p><strong>II. What specific components of the artifact showcase your
skills and abilities in software development?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Object-Oriented Design</strong>: The use of classes (Dog
and Monkey) to model real-world entities and manage their
attributes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Input Handling</strong>: Methods to intake and
validate user inputs, ensuring robust data management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Management</strong>: Utilization of ArrayList to
store and manage collections of animal objects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Implementation of try-catch
blocks to handle input mismatches and other exceptions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>III. How was the artifact improved?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Added detailed Javadoc comments
and inline comments to explain the purpose, inputs, and outputs of each
method.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Refactoring</strong>: Consolidated repetitive code
into reusable methods to improve maintainability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input Validation</strong>: Enhanced user input validation
and error handling to ensure the system can handle incorrect inputs
gracefully.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimization</strong>: Optimized loops and branching for
better performance and readability.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>3) Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet
with this enhancement in Module One?</u></strong></p>
<p>The enhancements made in Module One aligned with my course
objectives, particularly in improving code readability, error handling,
and refactoring. These improvements helped in achieving:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Better Code Maintainability</strong>: Through refactoring
and documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced User Experience</strong>: By implementing robust
input validation and error handling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Optimized Performance</strong>: By refining loops and
branching structures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I. Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage
plans?</strong></p>
<p>There have been no major changes to the outcome-coverage plans. The
enhancements met the initial objectives and demonstrated a clear
improvement in my software development capabilities.</p>

Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the
artifact.</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>I. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving
it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Importance of Documentation</strong>: Clear documentation
is crucial for maintaining and understanding code, especially when
working on collaborative projects or revisiting code after some
time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Effective Error Handling</strong>: Proper validation and
error handling improve user experience and prevent application crashes
due to unexpected inputs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Refactoring</strong>: Refactoring helps manage and
simplify codebases, making them easier to maintain..</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>II. What challenges did you face?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ensuring that the code remains simple and readable while
incorporating robust features like error handling and input validation/sanitation for data security.
It took much attention to detail, implementing comprehensive input
validation to cover all possible edge cases and user errors.</p></li>
